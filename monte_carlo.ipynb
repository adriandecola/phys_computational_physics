                "Monte Carlo methods are among the most important algorithms for computing integrals. They are our first *statistical* method: we get a remarkably powerful method that is simple to understand as long as we are willing to accept a random error. Why would we do this? Monte Carlo methods shine when the dimensionality of the problem is very large. For example, if you wanted to perform an integral over a set of classical particles like the molecules of air in the room, you have $6N$ dimensions for $N$ particles. Given that there is a very large number of molecules in the room, this is a very large number. \n",

                "Recalling our discussion of numerical integration techniques, using Simpson's method or Gaussian quadrature, we divide the interval up into $M$ segments, and the error in our integration falls like $M^{-\\delta}$, where $\\delta$ is some integer, 4 for Simpson's method. However, if you have $d$ dimensions, the total error in your solution becomes $M^{-\\delta/d}$, which is terrible if $d$ gets larger than 4. The more dimensions, the slower and slower the error goes away.\n",
                "\n",
                "The idea of Monte Carlo is incredibly simple: we randomly sample the high-dimensional space of the problem and use that sampling to construct an estimate of the integral we care about. In order to do so, we'll start by exploring random number generators.\n",

                "A random number generator (RNG) is a strange beast. It is an algorithm, expressed in a programming language that produces as series of random--uncorrelated--values. However, any algorithm is a series of discrete steps that can be followed in order and should produce the same results every time. So how can that generate randomness? The answer is that it can't. What an RNG can do is produce a series of *pseudorandom* numbers. These are numbers that are for practical purposes random, but are actually determined in a deterministic manner. The literature on RNGs is vast, but we're just going to use the `numpy` RNGs."

When :math:`n` is an integer,\n     |      :math:`\\frac{\\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\\Gamma(n)} = \\binom{N+n-1}{N}`, which is\n     |      the more common form of this term in the the pmf. The negative\n     |      binomial distribution gives the probability of N failures given n\n     |      successes, with a success on the last trial.\n     |      \n     |      If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a \"1\" appears,\n     |      then the probability distribution of the number of non-\"1\"s that\n     |      appear before the third \"1\" is a negative binomial distribution.\n     |      \n     |      Because this method internally calls ``Generator.poisson`` with an\n     |      intermediate random value, a ValueError is raised when the choice of \n     |      :math:`n` and :math:`p` would result in the mean + 10 sigma of the sampled\n     |      intermediate distribution exceeding the max acceptable value of the \n     |      ``Generator.poisson`` method. This happens when :math:`p` is too low \n     |      (a lot of failures happen for every success) and :math:`n` is too big (\n     |      a lot of sucesses are allowed).\n     |      Therefore, the :math:`n` and :math:`p` values must satisfy the constraint:\n     |      \n     |      .. math:: n\\frac{1-p}{p}+10n\\sqrt{n}\\frac{1-p}{p}\u003c2^{63}-1-10\\sqrt{2^{63}-1},\n     |      \n     |      Where the left side of the equation is the derived mean + 10 sigma of\n     |      a sample from the gamma distribution internally used as the :math:`lam`\n     |      parameter of a poisson sample, and the right side of the equation is\n     |      the constraint for maximum value of :math:`lam` in ``Generator.poisson``.\n     |      \n     |      References\n     |      ----------\n     |      ..

We can imagine using the Monte Carlo algorithm for finding area to generalize from something simple like the area of a circle to something complicated, like the area of a pond. Instead of using a computer, we could just throw rocks into a square area circumscribing the pond, and then count the number that go in. Again, comparing that to the number of stones thrown would give us an estimate of the area of the pond. However, unless it's a very small pond, you wouldn't be able to throw stones evenly (and even sampling is the key here) from one position.\n",

This may seem a bit silly, but it's actually quite useful because often times it is difficult to redraw a complete distribution of parameters, but modifying from the set you already have is easy.\n",

This allows us to construct a reversable chain. Typically, we want to be rejecting about 50% of our samples: if we reject too few, then our calculation will converge very slowly (that is, we will find the right answer only with a very large $N$). If we reject too many, we are not throwing away most of our trials.\n",

Try using it with different $N$ and $p$ to get about 50% accepted trials and a very rough (say 3 digits) approximation to $\\pi$ in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
